# Classifieds

This is the repository for Bethel University's own Classifieds website. Any user with a BCA account can log into the
site, browse the ads, and contact the seller directly. If they wish to sell something, they can also post their own ads
on the site. Users can edit their own posts, mark them as complete once the item is sold, or if it's not sold within
30 days it will be automatically expired.

Administrators of the site are able to manage the categories of posts, edit or delete posts that don't follow BU
guidelines, add contact entries to the database who don't have a BCA account, and post ads on the non-BCA contacts'
behalf. Any admin can promote non-admins to admin or demote current admins to regular users, but no admin can demote
themself. This way, there will always be at least one administrator to promote other admins.

The way the codebase has been set up, the same code can be used for BU's Book Exchange.
