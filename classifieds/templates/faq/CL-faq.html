    <h3>
        Buying
    </h3>
    <p>
        Look to buy an item? You can search for just about anything by using the Search function at the top page after
        signing in with your Bethel Account. Once you find the item you're looking for, clicking on it will bring you
        to a page with the seller's contact information (as well as a list of other items that he or she is selling).
        You can contact the seller by phone or email and arrange the details of the purchase.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Selling
    </h3>
    <p>
        Before you list anything that you want to sell, be sure to update your contact information, as this information
        is used by potential buyers who want to contact you. You can then post your items in the Classifies. <b>Please
        remember to remove items you have sold so people will not try to contact you about an item that you no longer
        have.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Responsibilities
    </h3>

        Classifieds.

    <h3>
        Avoiding Scams
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not extend payment to anyone you have not met in person.</li>
        <li>Beware offers involving shipping - deal with locals you can meet in person.</li>
        <li>Never wire funds (e.g. Western Union) - anyone who asks you to is a scammer.</li>
        <li>Don't accept cashier/certified checks or money orders - banks cash fakes, then hold you responsible.</li>
        <li>Transactions are between users only, no third party provides a &ldquo;guarantee&rdquo;.</li>
        <li>Never give out financial info (bank account, social security, paypal account, etc).</li>
        <li>Do not rent or purchase sight-unseenâ€”that amazing &ldquo;deal&rdquo; may not exist.</li>
        <li>Refuse background/credit checks until you have met landlord/employer in person.</li>
    </ul>
